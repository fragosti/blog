JustALevel is a Massive Open Online Course platform for the A-Level Computer Science curriculum in the United Kingdom.
I led the development of the project after securing a Â£50,000 contract from the U.K. Government with the founders of [Code at Uni](https://www.codeatuni.com/).

Working closely with [another engineer](https://nosaj.io/), I built a learning platform with a Content Management System, a test administration system and individual student progress tracking, along with other bells and whistles. The platform was used and enjoyed by thousands of students accross the United Kingdom that were studying for their A-level exams. All the content is original and made by [Code at Uni](https://www.codeatuni.com/). The [promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcKS8ekgoxI) (seen above) even went viral, garnering 500,000 views.

Despite some early success, the project is in maintenance mode, and is not being actively developed or promoted. The code is not currently open source, and the existing website only has some of the features of the original version.
