During my time at Yelp, I worked almost exclusively on search, and more specifically the search experience. There are a surprising amount of features buried inside the search experience alone, as different permutations of the page are surfaced to different verticals and keywords ("delivery" for example). Although I was focused on search, I made significant contributions across the stack: frontend, backend, and iOS.

<div class="flex justify-around flex-wrap items-center">

</div>

While I worked on many features, a lot of my time was spent on large re-writes and modernizations of the search stack. My last contribution was leading a cross-team, 6 engineer effort to modernize the search frontend infrastructure, basically re-implementing the search feature entirely on web. Prior to this, I led a team of 2 engineers in a complete re-write of the search feature in the iOS app in our migration from Objective-c to Swift.
