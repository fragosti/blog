<div class="my-10">
  <h1 class="mb-4"> Hi. </h1>
  <p>
    I'm Francesco â€“ a software engineer working at <a href="https://0x.org/" target="_blank">0x</a> on <a href="https://0x.org/api" target="_blank">0x-api</a> most recently, and all sorts of things prior to that.
    Previously, I worked at <a href="http://yelp.com/search" target="_blank">Yelp</a> on improving search as a full-stack and iOS engineer. 
    In my free time you'll find me hacking, exercising, eating or trying to read the entire Internet. I'm also into startups, crypto and all that.
