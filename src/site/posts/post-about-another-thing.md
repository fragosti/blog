it’s hard to explain how it felt waking up after this last show, knowing a chapter of our lives had just come to an end. After so many months spent touring, you might end up taking all this for granted. But then you walk on a stage like that and you suddenly realise you are going to keep this moment forever.

We’re sad but enthusiastic, exhausted but longing for more. After so many years, Moderat finally has become a real band and even more: a family. We won’t let it die.

Thank you so much for all the love.
It’ll take us a while but we’ll be back!

Stay tuned!

Szary, Sascha & Gernot.
