    In my free time you'll find me hacking, running, lifting, scheming, reading, or in the <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metaverse</a>.
    Besides that, I enjoy creating and releasing side-projects, some of which you can see in the <a href="/projects">projects page</a>.
    If you're interested in collaborating, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:francesco@fragosti.com">reach out.</a>

    I'm also into startups, crypto and all that.

    I studied Computer Science at <a href="https://duke.edu/">Duke University</a> and am from Milan, Italy originally.
